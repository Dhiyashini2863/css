<h1>Class Selector</h1>
<h2>Using in external styling</h2>
</center>
<p>-->A class selector in CSS is a way to target and style specific HTML elements based on their assigned class attribute. The class attribute allows you to apply a specific name (class name) to one or more HTML elements, and then you can use that class name as a selector in your CSS to style those elements consistently.</p>
<p class="highlight">-->Class selectors are powerful tools for creating consistent and reusable styles across your website or web application. They allow you to define styles separately from the HTML structure, making it easier to manage and update the design of your web pages.</p>
