    <p>-->The universal selector, represented by an asterisk (*), is a fundamental element in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) used to target and apply styles to all elements within an HTML document. When applied to a CSS rule, the universal selector matches every element on the page, regardless of its type, class, or ID.</p>
    <p>-->Usage: The universal selector is mainly used in cases where you want to apply a specific style to all elements within a document. It can be helpful when applying global styles or when you want to quickly reset default browser styles for a consistent starting point.</p>
